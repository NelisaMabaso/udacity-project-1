## Project Deliverables
There are two deliverables that are required for project completion.

1. A Github repository for your code.
2. A blog post of your findings.

**Your Github repository must have the following contents:**
- A README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgments.
- Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.
- You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary.

**For the blog post, pick a platform of your own choice. For example, it can be on your website, a Medium post (Josh's sample report(opens in a new tab) on How Do YOU Become A Developer?), or a Github blog post. Your blog** **must provide the following:**
- A clear and engaging title and image.
- Your questions of interest.
- Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.
